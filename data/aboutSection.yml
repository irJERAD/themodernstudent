  ## About The Modern Student

  **Simply:** This project was built out of a passion for what I love - Education - and what I find purpose in - Service.
  So, it is my greatest hope that somehow any of the information, articles, suggestions, thoughts or opinions shared here might become useful or instrumental in any way what-so-ever.
  Now, I do write, share, and craft pieces here with an idea of how and when you should apply them to your life, your classroom, or your relationship with your student-child.
  But by no means must you confine the application of whatever inspiration you receive here.
  Really we just want to get this conversation going, if you have not already started it. 
  And if you have started this conversation, good on ya, let's keep it going and get others involved.

  ## About Me

  There is really nothing special here. I love education. I love learning. And I LOVE teaching.
  Nothing feels so fulfilling as helping someone that is in dire need of understanding something - be it for a test, for their ability to go about their days a little better, or what is really fun is when someone needs a nudge to get them past their next paradigm shift (those wide open eyes..)

  ### I help underserved high school students find pleasure in their academic triumphs as they go on to college

  I have been unimaginably fortunate and grateful to have spent the last couple of year working with East Palo Alto Tutoring and Tennis [EPATT](https://www.epatt.org/)
