  ## Who, exactly, is The Modern Student for?

  The Modern Student - despite having the title "Student" in its name - was created specifically for Students (yes), Teachers, and Parents *(parents play a critical role in their children's academic careers)*
  The site is intended to host a set of tools, a platform, and a place to go for understanding or new ideas in this new world of education.

      #### Common Core State Standards

      What is this whole Common Core thing about anyways?
      I mean we all get the idea, right? Teach kids at one school the same as they teach them at another school - standardize the education process for K-12. 
      But why does it feel absurdly well.. different. Can't kids learn the same way we did? 
      "Its much simpler / more intuitive / easier" you insert the adjective that compares how you learned long division compared with how they want your child to learn it now.

      *I will keep this motivation short:* Thing is, Common Core is now **The System**. 
      Its the way your children will start their academic careers in K-12

      #### Beyond K-12

      Too many students - particularly those who do not count a college graduate among their close relatives - are not thinking about college early enough.
      When is early enough to think about life after k-12?
      We all know someone who dresses their baby in the outfits of Harvard, Yale, or their alma mater.
      And I suppose it would be financially prudent for parents to be thinking about college as soon as their child exits the womb.
      I strongly believe students should be thinking about college by 7th grade.
      They need time to learn about the many locations, envision themselves living in another part of the country.
      The earlier students start to consider which subjects they may want to explore further at a collegiate level, the more developed and evolved their sense of what is right for them will be.
      The most common reason I hear for students not going to college after their senior year of high school is that they *"Don't know what [they] want to do"*.
      Now think what a difference preparing for this transition earlier on in life would make in these student's lives?

      #### Inspire Enthusiasm Garner Investment

      We can help students see education under a different light. 
      Really, their school, classes, teachers, and even homework are all created and managed for their unique benefit.
      When a student can perceive how self-serving the entire education system is to them, they can free themselves from the trapped waist of time perspective they may have previously maintained.
      Things really turn up when we get students to see their academic careers as a vehicle which they manage and is capable of taking them anywhere in life, even as far as their dreams.
